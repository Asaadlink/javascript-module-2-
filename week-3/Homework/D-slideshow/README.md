# Challenge: "Image Carousel"

## Challenge Overview

Make a website which allows the user to navigate a set of images (first manually, then with an auto-playing slideshow).

# Level 1 Challenge

Make forward and back buttons to move _manually_ in that direction through a list of at least 4 images.

(e.g. When the user presses forward once, the display should move ONCE to the next image.)

You can use any images.

You can store the images within your app or you can use links to images hosted elsewhere ("hotlinking").

Here's a screenshot example from a completed level 2 challenge.

#### Task: Make the HTML and the buttons work

Make your buttons work to navigate forwards and backwards, manually.

### Task: more buttons - automated slideshow

Add the following buttons:

- auto-forward
- stop
- auto-backwards

These should allow automatic navigation through the images, say every 5 seconds.

### End of challenge!

Congratulations, you've finished the basics!
